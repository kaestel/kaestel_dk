				I'm the oddest of the evens.<br>
				<br>
				I'm part time revolutionary. I spend the other part serving the system I revolt against. Surely, one day this will lead to a breakdown. I wonder who will win.<br>
				<br>
				I don't follow rules - it tends to get really boring. I don't mind guidelines - occasionally they can be helpful. I like to challenge conventions in search for better alternatives.<br>
				<br>
				I think principles are only good for discussions. In real life you need to be able to adapt. Quickly. Or get stuck in a defense you might not even want to defend. It happens. Moral and ethics are much deeper than principles, and should be respected, at least to avoid bad conscience.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>What I'm really looking for</strong><br>
				Yeah, ok, I know this is not an official section of the profile, but I'm looking for more than just a perfect pattern-match. Actually a good relationship probably requires its differences. Differences help us grow as human beings. They add perspective and I find that essential. With that said, we probably won't get along, if you think the world is just fine and dandy in its current state.<br>
				<br>
				I am uncompromisingly focused on my personal projects. They involve rethinking every aspect of our society, challenging every norm and finally providing a credible and achievable alternative to our current way of living. For this reason, I might not be suited for a "normal" relationship. But I still dream. I have a lot to give, if you pay attention.<br>
				<br>
				I want to find someone who is willing to help me change the world, or at least try. Someone who believes we can do so much more than what we've been schooled to believe. Know the truth is always deeper, than what we are told.<br>
				<br>
				You can be quiet or loud as long as you shine. But please shine. We can all shine, if we just accept the color of our glow.<br>
				<br>
				Someone with their feet on the ground and their head in the clouds. Maybe someone who knows, we are both weak and strong. In different areas, at different times.<br>
				<br>
				If you think I am full of shit. Look in the mirror. Get a job, one you like.

				That's what my parents keeps asking. Fuck if I know.<br>
				<br>
				I'm trying to do right. Grasping the big picture. Being a good father.<br>
				<br>
				In between I'm am coding. I am an expert within logic, numbers and connecting the dots. It is not random, it just looks random. I suck at many things, but not this. I'm doing well in most peoples eyes, ... but me, I want more ... (in a less-kinda-fashion). So I write, I build, I play, I try … really hard.

				Mmmm ...<br>
				<br>
				Books ... Kurt Vonnegut, John Fowles, Svend Åage Madsen, Naomi Klein, Tor Nørretranders, Douglas Coupland, Joseph Heller, John Irving, William S. Burroughs, Douglas Adams ... and many others.<br>
				I love books. I love bookstores. I love buying books. I love reading books.<br>
				<br>
				Movies ... well, well ... The Terminal, Memento, The Count of Monte Cristo, The Time Machine, Vanilla Sky, 2 Days in Paris, Iron Man ... bla bla bla ... Terry Gilliam, Tarantino ... bla bla ... Pixar ... bla ... ok? :) I like movies as much as any dog, but it's all about entertainment to me. Motion art is not in my movies category. Lately I've been watching more series than movies. I guess I like the continuum of the series. Revolution, Weeds, Dexter, Californication, Lost, Curb your enthusiasm ...<br>
				<br>
				I do not own a TV. I don't like TV.<br>
				<br>
				Music ... Throughout my life I think the biggest outside influence have come from music. When Christopher Jones of Verbal Assault told me,<br>
				<br>
				We cannot change around<br>
				Until we change within<br>
				To scream and yell and sloganize<br>
				Only shields us from our own lies<br>
				Without understanding<br>
				We offer our own views<br>
				What the hell are we doing, rebels?<br>
				<br>
				I listened, I changed ...<br>
				<br>
				Jane's Addiction, Bad Religion, The Blue Van, Suicidal Tendencies, NoMeansNo, Bob Mould, Afghan Whigs, Soundgarden, Bell X1, early Bruce Springsteen, Cat Stevens, Cold War Kids, dEUS, David Bowie, Madrugada, Manic Street Preachers, The National Bank, Nick Drake ... and and and ... slightly alternative with a broad ear. I can listen to most music - but I'm sure to have an well reflected opinion (even if I keep it to myself).<br>
				<br>
				Without doubt my music collection is the heaviest of all of my possessions. Literally. I've moved a lot, I know. Nothing weighs more than my CDs - which is why I'm all in for the digital revolution.<br>
				<br>
				And Techno is not music. Just like spinning not being sport.<br>
				<br>
				Food ... finally food ... I love good food. I love preparing it. I love eating it. In particular I like potatoes. Crispy potatoes. And I don't like nuts. At all. I'm not allergic - just don't like them.
