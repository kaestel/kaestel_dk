	<h1>Plain as the Sun</h1>
	<p>
		I'm plain as a pancake and odd like nutella. I think it is a good combination, but admittedly I am not diet
		material. Don't scrape, it won't help. I am like that.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am a part time revolutionary. I spend the other part serving the system I revolt against. Surely, 
		one day this will lead to a breakdown. I wonder who will win.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am a coder. I am an expert within 
		logic, numbers and connecting the dots. It's not random, it just looks random. I may suck at many 
		things, but not this. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I challenge conventions in search for better alternatives. Too many rules are blindly
		accepted, even years after they have outlived themselves. I am uncompromisingly focused on 
		my personal goals. They involve rethinking every aspect of our society, challenging every 
		norm and finally providing a credible and achievable alternative to our current way of living. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm trying to do right. Grasping the big picture. Being a good father. Thinking ahead, 
		while being right here, right now. I walk, eat icecream in the rain. Hold her hand in mine, because 
		it calms me and gives me direction. I explore random combinations of green, seemingly plain holes in 
		the ground and find beauty in all this earth is giving us.
	</p>
	<p>
		I scream at the sky, when overwhelmed by injustice. It happens too often to ignore, and it is being
		ignored too often. What the fuck is wrong with you people. I am fighting back.
	</p>
	<p>
		I love the sun, it shines upon me.<br />
		I love the sea, it never fails to embrace me.<br />
		I love the mountains, they lift me up.<br />
		I love the sky, it has no end.<br />
		I love the flowers, they bring me hope.<br />
		I love the moon, she knows why.
	</p>
	<p>
		I try to love everything <br />
		but sometimes I fail.
	</p>
	<p>
		I dream of things I can’t entirely explain.<br />
		I feel an urge to make this world a better place.<br />
		I contain solutions I cannot yet imagine.<br />
		I believe everything and everyone is connected.<br />
		I think we are all responsible though not all of us live up to our responsibility.<br />
		I want to promote humanity.<br />
		I fear the ignorance that threatens to end everything.
	</p>
	<p>
		But ...
	</p>
	<p>
		I envision global peace and unity.
	</p>
	<p>
		And ...
	</p>
	<p>
		I love life.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you think I am full of shit. Look in the mirror. Get a job. One you like. Stop being a fucking ant.
	</p>

	<h2>Historia vitae</h2>
	<p>
		I spent a couple of hours being born, in Haslev, which I don't remember visiting ever again. The rest of 
		that year I didn't really get anything done. To be honest, it is a blur. Not unlike some periods late in my
		teens. I spent my chiildhoon in <a href="http://maps.google.dk?q=44.123456,12.23452">Ringsted</a> and 
		<a href="http://maps.google.dk">Høm</a> on the outskirts, where I had fun failing horrobly at football 
		and, more importantly, my attempt at adapting to the schooling system. I was bored out of my mind and 
		punished for it.
	</p>
	<p>I spend my late teens frequenting Sorø for highschool and later Banking.
		
		
		
		The highlights from the early 
		years are probably learning how to walk and then talk. Well, and when I crashed head first into a 
		fence on my bike riding down the rainsoaked and slippery hill. The lesson is: if you know 
		your hill ends abruptly in a fence, take note of road condition and consider wearing a helmet.
	</p>


		I want to learn, 
		discover, 
		feel and understand. 
		
		I want to be awfully wrong, 
		notice in time, 
		learn my lesson and see where it leads.
		
		I want to get in trouble,
		for the right cause,
		find my way out,
		without loosing . 
		
		Follow my intuition, 
		surprise myself and be surprised by others. 
		
		Look back with a smile,
		and look ahead with and even bigger smile.
	
	
Check latin - kort livshistorie

Jeg er vokset op i Ringsted og Høm hmmm ... og flyttede til København som 19-20 årig. Min famile er flyttet til Fårevejle (mellem Holbæk og Kalundborg), så jeg har ikke ret meget tilbage i Ringsted. Min morfar bor der stadig, men ellers ...
Jeg fik en efternøler af en lille-søster som 13 årig, men hun er primært vokset op i Fårevejle og bor i Holbæk idag ...
Oprindeligt er jeg uddannet bank-assistent fra den Danske Bank, men det var ikke lige mig. Faktisk vil jeg sige, at det væsentligste jeg tog med mig derfra, var en ide om hvad jeg IKKE ville, og hvilke vilkår jeg ikke ville det under ... :-)

Jeg fik i stedet job i Lån & Spar Bank, som har et helt andet menneskesyn, og jeg fik en fantastisk chef ... og det udviklede sig. De startede en Internet afdeling tilbage i 1997, hvor jeg blev ansat, og så tog tingene en drejning. Jeg havde ikke programmeret før (med undtagelse en lille smule om 10-12 årig), men det gik hurtigt op for mig, at jeg havde flair for det, og at jeg i øvrigt rigtigt godt kunne lide det ... :-) Så selvom jeg blev ansat som bankmand, endte jeg som programmør. Efter et par år i banken, havde jeg brug for nye udfordringer og søgte til Networkers, der på det tidspunkt (i 1999), blev hypet som en af de her fantastiske IT eventyr ... hehe ... og fik et job.

Det var ret syret, for det gik virkelig hurtigt ... da jeg startede i Networkers var vi 45 ... kort efter fusionerede vi med Framtidsfabriken, blev til Framfab, og i løbet af kort tid ansatte vi 25 nye om måneden ... så vi endte, lige inden luften gik af ballonen (ca halvandet år senere), med at være 330 i DK og 3000 på verdensplan ... vi kunne det hele og der var penge nok ... troede vi :-)

Og så sagde det bang ... og så gik det lige så hurtigt den anden vej ... og et år senere var vi 300 på verdensplan og 60 i Danmark ... havde fået en klassisk konsulent chef, og det hele var lidt skidt. Specielt stemningen over den måde folk blev bahandlet på. Jeg sad som personale-ansvarlig for min faggruppe, og havde knoklet røven ud af bukserne for at holde hovedet oven vande ... og da der endelig kom lidt ro på bixen igen, havde jeg brug for at komme lidt væk ...

Så jeg købte en sejlbåd og tog 9 måneders orlov ... sejlede ud i verden og endte 6 måneder senere i Barcelona ... da jeg begyndte at mangle penge, var der heldigvis lidt små-opgaver her og der, fra Framfab og tidligere kollegaer, der var endt alle mulige steder, efter den voldsomme nedskæring ...

Og så blev jeg lige pludselig selvstændig ...

Jeg arbejdede kun med danske kunder, så da jeg flyttede tilbage til Danmark, var alle bare glade, og jeg kunne fortsætte som selvstændig, uden at skulle overveje det videre ... det var faktisk bare blevet lettere at komme til møder :-)

Jeg er ret glad for mit arbejde ... jeg nyder de tekniske (og logiske) udfordringer ... og der er nok at lave, god løn, og jeg kan selv bestemme hvor meget og hvornår jeg vil arbejde ... rimeligvis :-)



1980 - 1994 :: Skt. Joseph Skole, Sorø Akademi, Ringsted-Sorø Handelsskole.
Well as school is in Denmark. Never liked it much, until it was all over. However I did learn some interesting stuff such as spelling and counting. Later I even picked up some spelling in other languages, speaking with a terrible accent, combining numbers and figuring out just how that X got mixed up with those numbers.

1994 - 1996/October :: Den Danske Bank.
What's a young boy to do? Learned how to wear a suit and a tie and just follow the manual ... and how to hate it.

1996/October - 1997/January :: Telemarketing. Teledane og HVL-Gruppen.
Anything but banking ... so I learned how to sell stuff on the phone. Never was very good at bending the truth so I didn't sell a lot. Basically it was one of those experiences defining what not to do.

1997/February - 1997/July :: Sales department, Lån & Spar Bank.
Trying another bank to see what it is like. It was better! Having the best boss ever taught me what a difference it makes.

1997/July - 1999/July :: Internet department, Lån & Spar Bank.
Well my boss was put in charge of the new Internet department and that Internet thing seemed quite interesting. In 1998 we launched the worlds first Internet based online banking system and started developing the ideas of a pure Internet based bank. These ideas later came to life in NEXTbank. While I worked in Lån & Spar Bank I moved from banking into programming. I worked during the day and went to school at night. Along the way it became time to move on.
Technologies :: HTML, JavaScript, Perl, C++.

1999/July - 2002/August :: Framfab (Networkers, Framtidsfabriken), Denmark.
I got hired as Interface Developer in what appeared to be the company I envisioned in my dreams. Fast pace, crazy parties, friends like family, the we-will-conquer-the-world feeling. The bubble was just being filled and while it was still filling Framfab Denmark grew from app. 40 to app. 300 employees and I became the Interface Development Manager in Denmark, in charge of 20 Interface Developers at the most. But as you know the industry wasn't meant to grow that fast and it took everyone a little too long to figure this out, so it started falling apart. I think we were quite lucky and we managed to hold on to most of the best people and clients while resizing the business. In the late summer of 2002 we were back on track and about 65 employees, hereof 10 Interface Developers. It had been a rough ride and it had become time to think.

2002/August - 2003/January :: In June 2002 I bought a sailing boat because I felt it would be a great alternative to sitting in front of a computer. I had also sold my apartment and most of my belongings and I moved onto the boat. A couple of months later I decided I knew enough about sailing and I asked for 9 months leave and left Denmark sailing. I sailed through the English Channel, across the Biscay, down and in through the Strait of Gibraltar and ended up in San Jose in the southeastern part of Spain. It was amazing!!! However, along the way somehow I was persuaded to come back to Denmark and help my friends at Framfab with another Nike Football launch.

2006/June - Present :: Freelance, Copenhagen, Denmark.
