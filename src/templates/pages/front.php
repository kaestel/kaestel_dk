	<h1>The plain geek</h1>
	<p>
		Geeks are passionate people. I am sorry to disrupt the common, but narrowminded, interpretation
		of geeks. We DO have a life and we are NOT wasting our time. It's our excessive passion that turns us into geeks, 
		and that passion drives our curiosity to dig further and further into our subjects, whatever it might be. 
		If you don't get it, perhaps you are just not smart enough and I urge you to try a little harder.

	<p>No geek is plain. Normal is weird.</p>
