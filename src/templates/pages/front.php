	<h1>The plain geek</h1>
	<p>
		Geeks are passionate people. I am sorry to disrupt the common, but narrowminded, interpretation
		of us. We DO have a life and we are NOT boring. It's our excessive passion that turns us into geeks, 
		and that passion drives our curiosity to dig further and further into our subjects, whatever it might be. 
		If you don't get it, perhaps you are just not smart enough and I urge you to try a little harder to 
		understand us.

	<p>No geek is plain. Normal is weird.</p>
